To-Do List

Trogdor Beta [gameplay-complete basic port of Trogdor]:
Polish:

Final:
- Prepare release materials (icons, descriptions, etc.)

Stretch Goals:
- Port to LibRetro core
	- Coolness:   5
	- Difficulty: 4?
	- Analysis:   Well worth the trouble. This would likely lead to the game running on many devices it wasn't originally designed for. Difficulty depends on how easily SDL 1.2 apps can be ported to a core.
- Port to Miyoo Mini (and other retro handhelds?)
	- Coolness:   3
	- Difficulty: 2
	- Analysis:   Not a big deal, but at least one other SDL 1.2 game has been ported to Miyoo Mini; so if porting this would be trivial, might as well. Do this as practice for LibRetro?
- Port to 3DS
	- Coolness:   3
	- Difficulty: 3
	- Analysis:   I'm not sure how good the 3DS's SDL port is.
- Port to Xbox (original)
	- Coolness:   3
	- Difficulty: 4
	- Analysis:   I'm not sure how good the Xbox's SDL port is, but I'd assume it's good since I've heard the Xbox had a strong homebrew scene. We'll see.
- Port to PS2
	- Coolness:   2
	- Difficulty: 4
	- Analysis:   I'm not sure how good the PS2's SDL port is, and this isn't a system I'm overly attached to. Maybe a LibRetro core could run on this instead?
- Port to Dreamcast:
	- Coolness:   5
	- Difficulty: 5
	- Analysis:   The absolute madman goal. Unfortunately, I think Dreamcast's SDL port is barebones, and the 16 MB of RAM could definitely be an issue. I have no idea if this would actually work, but it would be great.
