To-Do List

Trogdor Alpha [gameplay-complete basic port of Trogdor]:
Polish:
- Rework gameWidth/gameHeight/GAME_WIDTH/GAME_HEIGHT/DEFAULT_GAME_WIDTH/DEFAULT_GAME_HEIGHT into three sizes:
	- GAME_WIDTH/GAME_HEIGHT: The size of the Trogdor game; locked to 250 and 180 respectively
	- appWidth/appHeight: The size of the program; initialized and locked when the game is first opened, determined by the setting from save data (like what SuDokuL did)
	- windowWidth/windowHeight: The size of the window; starts out equal to appWidth/appHeight, but can be resized; scaling should scale app relative to window size
- If window is resized while integer scaling is enabled, snap window size to app multiple if within 10%
- Fix text
	- It doesn't have to be completely polished for Alpha, but there are some major issues: 6pt font is too blurry but also too big for the 250x180 game window (despite matching the original game?). So even though it won't match the original game, 8pt font should be used instead, and text positions should be adjusted to allow for this. Also, maybe text should go outside the game window? Outside of the 250x180 game window and into the 320x240 full window
- Refactoring
	- Change macros to inline functions or constexprs
	- Fix easy compiler warnings (generally caused by type conversions and signed/unsigned mismatches)
- Rework sound system to only load chunks of sound as they're needed instead of having all sound loaded into RAM at once
	- This will reduce load time at the start of the game (while ideally maintaining load times everywhere else) and significantly reduce RAM usage (essential for weaker systems)
- Adjust end of level flash
- Add art to Level Beaten and Game Over screens
- Verify that all game logic matches Flash game (it should already, but it's been so long since I worked on this that I don't remember)
	- When should knights move both home and offset? Offset only? Neither?
- Verify that the SDL1 and SDL2 versions look and run equally well
- Properly destroy all resources when closing game
- Polish controls for all systems
- Make sure instructions screen is accurate for controls on all systems
Final:
- Test all versions: PC, Android, Switch, Wii U, Wii, Gamecube, Vita, PSP
- Write Readme
- ???

Trogdor Classic [faithful recreation of original Trogdor flash game]:
Features:
- Add animation to Level Beaten and Game Over screens
- Rework cutscene system so that animations are easier to add
	- It's okay if the implementation has to be slightly inefficient to make this work, this really isn't that intensive of a game
- Add art and animation to all cutscenes
- Restore the original game's unused High Scores screen
- Add basic Records screen (page 4; L/R to change pages)
Polish:
- Polish opening graphics (Videlectrix, etc.)
- Add "Coming Eventually" screen for Trogdor Reburninated (page 5; L/R to change pages)
- Add "Want more?" screen for other system ports (page 6; L/R to change pages)
Final:
- Test all versions: PC, Android, Switch, Wii U, Wii, Gamecube, Vita, PSP
- ???

Trogdor Reburninated [enhanced port of Trogdor with additional options, achievements, and more; mainly inspired by XBLA ports of arcade games]:
Features:
- Add new title screen
- Add new main menu
- Add all Reburninated settings
- Add achievements
- Add more detailed credits screen
- Add History of Trogdor screen
Final:
- Test all versions: PC, Android, Switch, Wii U, Wii, Gamecube, Vita, PSP
- Make a trailer?
- ???

Stretch Goals:
- Port to LibRetro core
	- Coolness:   5
	- Difficulty: 4?
	- Analysis:   Well worth the trouble. This would likely lead to the game running on many devices it wasn't originally designed for. Difficulty depends on how easily SDL 1.2 apps can be ported to a core.
- Port to Miyoo Mini (and other retro handhelds?)
	- Coolness:   3
	- Difficulty: 2
	- Analysis:   Not a big deal, but at least one other SDL 1.2 game has been ported to Miyoo Mini; so if porting this would be trivial, might as well. Do this as practice for LibRetro?
- Port to 3DS
	- Coolness:   3
	- Difficulty: 3
	- Analysis:   I'm not sure how good the 3DS's SDL port is, and the 400x240 top screen resolution could be an issue. At the very least, it would probably look worse than any other version.
- Port to Xbox (original)
	- Coolness:   3
	- Difficulty: 4
	- Analysis:   I'm not sure how good the Xbox's SDL port is, but I'd assume it's good since I've heard the Xbox had a strong homebrew scene. We'll see.
- Port to PS2
	- Coolness:   2
	- Difficulty: 4
	- Analysis:   I'm not sure how good the PS2's SDL port is, and this isn't a system I'm overly attached to. Maybe a LibRetro core could run on this instead?
- Port to Dreamcast:
	- Coolness:   5
	- Difficulty: 5
	- Analysis:   The absolute madman goal. Unfortunately, I think Dreamcast's SDL port is barebones, and the 16 MB of RAM could definitely be an issue. I have no idea if this would actually work, but it would be great.
