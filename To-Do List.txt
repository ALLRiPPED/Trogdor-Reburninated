Final:
- Test and finalize
	- Switch

		- Final testing needed
	- Vita
		- Final testing needed

		- All sound takes extremely long to load; the best solution may be to use something other than SDL_mixer (unfortunately)
		- Spaces show up as periods in integer scaling for some reason...
		- D-pad input stutters (but analog input is fine)
		- ARROWED/SWORDED text doesn't show up? Or maybe the slow music load is moving past it?

Stretch Goals:
- Port to Miyoo Mini (and other retro handhelds?)
	- Coolness:   3
	- Difficulty: 2
	- Analysis:   Not a big deal, but at least one other SDL 1.2 game has been ported to Miyoo Mini; so if porting this would be trivial, might as well. Do this as practice for LibRetro?
- Port to 3DS
	- Coolness:   3
	- Difficulty: 3
	- Analysis:   I'm not sure how good the 3DS's SDL port is.
- Port to Xbox (original)
	- Coolness:   3
	- Difficulty: 4
	- Analysis:   I'm not sure how good the Xbox's SDL port is, but I'd assume it's good since I've heard the Xbox had a strong homebrew scene. We'll see.
- Port to PS2
	- Coolness:   2
	- Difficulty: 4
	- Analysis:   I'm not sure how good the PS2's SDL port is, and this isn't a system I'm overly attached to. Maybe a LibRetro core could run on this instead?
- Port to Dreamcast:
	- Coolness:   5
	- Difficulty: 5
	- Analysis:   The absolute madman goal. Unfortunately, I think Dreamcast's SDL port is barebones, and the 16 MB of RAM could definitely be an issue. I have no idea if this would actually work, but it would be great.
